data types:
  discrete -- each point is meaningful in isolation
  cumulative -- the discrete derivative of the points is meaningful
  binary -- points do not have y values, the series tracks presence of events in time

series types:
  daily
  real-time

series parameters:
  convolution-width (default 20, 0=none, eventually auto (trimmed mean of constant * average interval))
  units
  comment
  show standard deviation envelope (* constant)
  acceptable values ((min, max) is an inclusive range, (0,0) means all)
  acceptable deltas ((min, max) is an inclusive range, (0,0) means all)
    values outside acceptable ranges are ignored in the series
    should be able to override from the commandline
  input warning if value is unreasonable (option is, say, more than const * std dev from recent values)

Think about combining series for analysis.  Maybe this means
outputting on stdout or to file as tabular data to be processed by
gnuplot or other.

Text output options.

API for getting data.

At the commandline, a duplicate data point should require an --overwrite flag to succeed.

At the commandline, an apparent outlier point should require a --force flag to succeed.

Use leveldb.


Increasingly, I think the organisational strategy should be a
domain-specific language.  Let's have a go at defining it.
