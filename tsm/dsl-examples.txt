Time series and operations that tsm should be able to handle:

Data that makes sense on its own, such as mass measurements.

    "mass"
    apply[convolve-triangle, "mass"] max-min-envelope "mass"

Data where a discrete derivative is required, such as reading a gas meter.

    discrete-derivative "gas"

Data representing isolated events, such as "watered the plants today".

    weekly_average = mean[7] exists "watered-plants"
    monthly_average = mean[30] exists "watered-plants"

(The exists function returns 1 if the point exists, 0 otherwise.)

Data representing supply of an item.  We might want to see usage
without being distracted by resupply.  We might also want to not see
days of excessive usage.

    // Supply levels
    "widgets"
    // Usage, ignoring resupply
    positive discrete-derivative "widgets"
    // Usage, ignoring resupply and any depletions exceeding 100
    ignore-if-greater(100) positive discrete-derivative "widgets"

Reset-able cumulative data, such as ping data (1 if reachable, 0 if not).

    // Count number of 0's, reset to 0 when we see a 1
    count-with-reset[0, 1] "pings"
